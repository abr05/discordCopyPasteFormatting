# discordCopyPasteFormatting
This is a simple webpage that allows you to paste Discord chats in of any kind, and copy out formatted text without images, emojis, reactions, or usernames, while preserving italics, bold, newlines, and whatnot. 

Provided as-is. The parsing is done entirely with javascript in your browser, no external parties receive the data.
